Bioimpedance Imaging Problem
----------
<img src="bioimpedance.png" width="700px"/>

**Two motivations:**
* _Reconstruct multiple measurements simultaneously;_
* _Enhance the reconstructed quality especially when SNR is low._


Proposed Approach
---------
Multiple Measurement Model (MMV) + Spaese Bayesian Learning (SBL).


FC-SBL code
---------
* fcsbl
* total variation
